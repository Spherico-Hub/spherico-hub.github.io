If you already have a setup for your configuration, you can follow these steps to import them into a new instance.
You may have to follow those steps whenever you update, or when the server moves on to a new season.

<Steps>
1. Locate the `options.txt` file and `xaero` folder.
    - They will usually be located under the root file of your `minecraft` folder. 
    - To access it from the Prism Launcher, select your old instance and click on 'Folder' on the right sidebar. 
2. Back up the `options.txt` file and `xaero` folder in a safe location.
     - *The desktop will do fine.*
3. Update/Install your instance of the game.
4. Paste the `options.txt` file and `xaero` folder into the new instance's `minecraft` folder. 

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution" title="Compatibility notice">
Note that config files may not be compatible between different versions of the modpack.
If such a file is incompatible, you can always remove it from the `minecraft` folder and it will replace itself when launching the game.
